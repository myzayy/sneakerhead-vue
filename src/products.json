    "description": "The 1460 boot. The Original. Born 1st April 1960, and named after the date. Our unmistakable 8-eye boot started out life at the feet of workers — and soon became a cultural icon. It’s instantly recognizable by its yellow welt stitching, scripted heel loop, unique sole tread, and other distinctly DM’s features. The wide, rounded toe shape and grooved, air-cushioned sole keep you bouncing even on your longest days. And the durable Smooth leather shapes itself around you — more yours with every wear.",
